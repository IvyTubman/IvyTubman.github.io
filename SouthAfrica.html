       <P> In August my mom, grandma, aunt, and I went to South Africa. We attended a few safaris and visited Cape Town. It was such a fun trip! We saw all the animals and ate great food! There was lots to see. From the landscape to museums.

 <P> The above photo we are on the Cape of Good Hope. We took a bus up the mountain, then hiked the top. There was a place to eat and a gift shop there as well. Lots of monkeys live on the Cape of Good Hope as well. </P>
 <P> We saw lions, elephants, zebras, monkeys, and giraffes. Here are two of my favorite photos of the elephant and lion we saw. We all were always looking for animals while riding around in the jeeps on the safaris. I captured a great photo of my family looking for animals. Over all it was an amazing trip! We had so many laughs and great memeories made together on this trip! </P>
