 <P> Welcome to my website! Let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a keyholder at Bath and Body Works and I am a barista two days a week at a coffee shop in the mall. I love both my jobs. </P>
 <P> Originally I am from Cape Cod Massachusetts. My mom's side all lives there. We lived only 100 steps from my grandmothers and same from my Aunt and Uncle's house. We were also only one mile from the bay side beach and only a five minute drive to the ocean side. I love being able to call Cape Cod my home. I try to visit as often as I can as well. </P>
