 <p style="float: left; clear: left"><img src="jumprope.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" ></p> <P> I have been a competitive jump roper for thirteen year. I started in first grade. I have competed Regionally, Nationally, and at the worlds level. For worlds we traveled to Sweden and Norway. We placed fifth of the world for womens twenty year old category for double dutch. In 2014 my double dutch team placed fourth in the grand national competition. I really enjoy jump rope. Here at UMaine I practice in the gym sometimes and people will ask me questions or watch me. I would love to start a team but it takes a lot of time, energy, and funding. For now I will keep competing with my team from back home. Worlds is in Canada this year. I have attched a link to one of the videos I am in. My team is called the Brewster Bayside Skippers. </P>

<p> Another sport passion of mine is rowing. The crew team. I started freshman year of high school and loved it ever since. I worked my way up to the varsity level. I helped coach little kids for a while too. We were entered into the Head of the Charles Regatta race in Boston MA. One of the largest Regattas to ever get to race in. This was a dream come true. We got to race my favorite boat, the coxed quad. For being new rowers on the course we did very well. I still try to go every year and watch my old team race just as they did for me. If you aren't familiar with the sport of rowing here is the link to the Head of the Charles webpage. </p>
